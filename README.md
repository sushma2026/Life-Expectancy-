# Life-Expectancy-

ABSTRACT 

In developed countries the life expectancy of people is high as compared to the people of 
developing countries of the world. What kinds of factors are involved in this world wide life 
phenomenon? A very huge number of articles are available on the life expectancy of the people 
at world level. But there is no such type of work which identifies clearly the factors responsible 
for this global inequality regarding life expectancy. So this review study seeks to gather the 
worthwhile contribution of world researcher about all the basics factors responsible for the low 
and high life expectancy of developed and developing countries of the world. After study the 
different perspectives discovered by the different experts, the researcher arrived at conclusion 
that low life standard, poor health facilities, poor governmental policies of health, high level of 
population, terrorism and low level of education are the factors responsible for the low life 
expectancy of developing countries. Similarly it is also concluded by the researcher that high life 
standard, availability of health facilities, standard governmental policies of health, and provision 
of standard education are main factors responsible for the high life expectancy of the developed 
countries of the world.

1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 OVERVIEW 
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to 
live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic 
Circumstances, Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of 
their birth and other demographic factors. This problem statement provides a way to 
predict average life expectancy of people living in a country when various factors such 
as year, GDP, education, alcohol intake of people in the country, expenditure on 
healthcare system and some specific disease related deaths that happened in the country 
are given.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Life is a broad term in nature. It is quite difficult to understand the meaning of life. In 
science, life may be defined as “the possession of self-sustaining biological 
processes” In other words, life is the name of self- sustaining biological process which 
include homeostasis (ability of cells to maintain its physiological functions), 
organization (linkage between the functions of all parts of the body), metabolism, 
growth, development, adaptation, response to stimuli, and reproduction. It means that 
life is the name of such quality, which makes a person able to survive in the society . 
Life expectancy which refers to the number of years, a person is expected to live base on 
the statistical average. It depends upon geographical background of the area . In pre 
modernization of world, life expectancy was round about 30 years in all regions of 
the world. Life expectancy increased in early 19th century but till there is same countries 
while it stay low in the rest of the world. It shows that health standard is not same across 
the globe. In 20 century this global inequality is decreased and similarly today the life 
expectancy is approaching up to 70 to 75 years and similarly no country of the world 
today having low life expectancy than the countries of high life expectancy in 1800 .
Developed & Developing Countries of the World 
At world level, there are two types of countries. i.e. developed countries and developing 
countries. Developed countries based on the economic status like grass domestic 
products (GDP) and Gross National Product (total value of a nation's goods and services 
(GNP), per capita income, industrialization, standard and style of living, etc. 
similarly developed countries provide free health facilities and security to its citizen 
while all those countries which lacking these facilities are known as developing 
countries. The author further listed the few differences which shows that why life 
expectancy is high among the developed and low in developing countries of the 
world. 
These differences are 
1. Developed countries having high income as compared to developing countries.
2. Developed countries having high literacy rate while in developing counties is it is 
low.
3. Developed countries have good health facilities while developing counties it is 
lacking.
4. Developed counties support the industrial aspects of the countries while developing 
countries getting supports from industrial aspects of the country.
5. In developed countries standard of life is high as compared to developing countries.
6. In developed countries utilization of income generating resources are properly 
planned while in developing countries it is lacking.
7. In developed countries the birth and death rate is law while the birth and death 
rate is high in developing countries.
 
2. LITERATURE SURVEY

2.1 RELATED WORK

a. PYTHON - Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming 
language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of 
significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help 
programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is 
dynamically typed AND supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
b. GOOGLE COLAB – Colaboratory or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google 
Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the 
browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education.

2.2 SYSTEM STUDY
 This survey is done to comprehend the need and prerequisite of the general 
population, and to do as such, we went through different sites and applications and looked 
for the fundamental data. Based on these data, we made an audit that helped us get new 
thoughts and make different arrangements for our task. We reached the decision that there 
is a need of such application and felt that there is a decent extent of progress in this field.
